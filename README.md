# AxisOfSymmetry
The study of symmetries of binary sequences.
The following problem is solved:
Given a binary sequence of length 'n', consisting of 0 and 1.
If it is depicted as a regular 'n' square, then it will contain a certain number of symmetry axes (or not).
Sequences that can be obtained from each other by cyclic shift are equivalent => form one equivalence class.
It is required to determine how many for a given 'n' and 'k' (where the 'n' is the number of elements in the sequence and 'k' is the number of units) there are equivalence classes and how many symmetry axes are in each class.
